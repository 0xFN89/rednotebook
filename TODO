TODO / Roadmap:

If you have any suggestions or comments, feel free to contact me in the forum or
per mail. Even if a feature is listed here already it might speed up the 
implementation if you tell me that you'd like its addition ;)



=== Features that will probably soon be implemented ===

O i18n
O Better comment code
O Undu and Redo functionality extended for Categories (use function pointers for restoring things)
O Allow submitting new entries with <Enter>
O Switch from libglade to GtkBuilder
O way of embedding a formula/tag/etc that I can put in the template to automatically insert the current date (2 requests)
O Spell Checker (unify markup and html textviews first) (3 requests)
O allow opening config file from within RedNotebook? (On advanced tab)




=== Maybe even some of those features will make it into RedNotebook ===

O Hyperlinks in Categories? -> Already implemented, add documentation
O Tags in text entries (e.g. @film:Batman)?
O Encryption XOR Password
O Allow dragging of files and pictures into RedNotebook
O remove search for categories and tags, as clouds already do that?
O Allow inserting directories
O Allow opening pictures by double-clicking them
O Copy/Paste category notes
O provide TrueCrypt encryption HowTo for Linux
O Use threads for file loading and link opening (Data opening takes 1.1 sec, other setups take 0.3 sec)
O Rethink linebreaks (Changing paragraphs in txt2tags will probably crash everything, so wait for rich text editing first)
O SSH, FTP saving -> Conduit HowTo







=== Roadmap ===

1.0
O WYSIWYG editing as an alternative to markup text?

0.9
O Automatic insertion of photo links for current day
O Automatic insertion of holidays

0.8.x
O Import of exported backups
O Automatic Backups

0.8.5
O Task bar icon

0.8.4
O Password protection
O Make RedNotebook portable
    O User dir configurable
O Use html preview of categories for search window
O Hide cloud words with right-click
O Show number of different words

0.8.3
X New statistics dialog with daily word count. Shows number of words, lines, and chars
X Fill some days of the journal with solutions of common question at first startup
X Add option to restore that example content. It will be placed after the last edited day
X Add "Autostart RedNotebook" option
    X Linux: Option in Program
    X Win: Installer Option
X Let the user finish a new category entry by hitting ENTER
X Put the initial focus in the text window for direct typing (LP:406450)










=== Features that will **not** be implemented ===

- ``monospaced`` (we only want one font)
- verbatim / raw ( """/"" - supported, undocumented) (too confusing / poorly behaving) 
- remote pictures (pictures would have to be downloaded and saved in a folder for exports)
- dataDir Lock (for multiple TRN instances) (unneeded)
- make date format configurable for exports (probably no one needs this as i18n already exists)
