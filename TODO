TODO / Roadmap:

If you have any suggestions or comments, feel free to contact me in the forum or
per mail. Even if a feature is listed here already it might speed up the 
implementation if you tell me that you'd like its addition ;)


=== Roadmap ===

0.8.8
O i18n
  X mark translatable strings
    O statistics, options
  O setup translatinons at launchpad
  X make German translation
  X install mo files with setup.py
X Add "Start minimized to tray" command line parameter
X Cloud words white list for short words

0.8.9
X Windows: RedNotebook can now be run in portable mode
  (edit the setting in "RedNotebook-directory/files/default.cfg")
   O Propose to portableapps
   O Show message in windows installer
   O Save dataDir relative to exe
   
0.8.x
O Import of exported backups
O Password protection

0.9
O Automatic insertion of photo links for current day
O Automatic insertion of holidays

1.0
O WYSIWYG editing as an alternative to markup text?







=== Maybe even some of those features will make it into RedNotebook ===

O Hyperlinks in Categories -> Already implemented, add documentation
O Encryption XOR Password XOR provide TrueCrypt encryption HowTo for Linux
O Allow inserting directories (Do not add menu item, just document the feature)
O SSH, FTP saving -> Conduit HowTo

O Use threads for file loading and link opening? (Data opening takes 1.1 sec, 
  other setups take 0.3 sec)
  (Probably a bad idea since threads are a source of errors)
O Rethink linebreaks? (Changing paragraphs in txt2tags will probably crash 
  everything, so wait for rich text editing first)
  (Current behaviour should be fine)
O allow opening config file from within RedNotebook?
  (Probably no good idea as some options might be unavailable or confusing)
O Add option for time interval between automatic savings? (KISS)
O Convert all read strings to unicode before working with them?



=== Features that will **not** be implemented ===

- ``monospaced`` (we only want one font)
- verbatim / raw ( """/"" - supported, undocumented) (too confusing / poorly behaving)
- remote pictures (pictures would have to be downloaded and saved in a folder for exports)
- dataDir Lock (for multiple TRN instances) (unneeded)
- make date format configurable for exports (probably no one needs this as i18n already exists)
- Tags in text entries (e.g. @film:Batman) (KISS)
- remove search for categories and tags, as clouds already do that (Unituitive and not trivial to remove)
- Allow dragging of files and pictures into RedNotebook (default behavior is good enough)
- Copy/Paste category entries (Too complicated)
- Add --portable command line parameter (The default config file is better)
- word wrapping while editing category entries (too complicated, would involve writing C code)
- Language selection for spell checking (is already implemented in new versions of gtkspell)
- Image resizing (KISS)
- Todo tab next to clouds (KISS)
- Automatic Backups (KISS, intruding, gentle messages are better)
