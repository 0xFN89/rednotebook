TODO / Roadmap:

If you have any suggestions or comments, feel free to contact me in the forum or
per mail. Even if a feature is listed here already it might speed up the 
implementation if you tell me that you'd like its addition ;)

Bugfixes only

1.1.x

  X Movies
  O Web History (Firefox addon is being written by zeitgeist devs)

  O Lifeograph
  O Evernote
  O ics?
  O Wordpress?
  O Treepad?
  X Tomboy
  
O Provide an option to export only days with a certain tag
O Automatic insertion of photo links for current day (use zeitgeist or tracker to search hard-disk for photos)
O Automatic insertion of holidays (Search a website for holidays and display them in the category "Holidays")
O Make startup faster
O Fix status icon on XFCE (LP:525196)
O Custom-style Journals? (Allow custom css files for preview rendering, e.g. Mono-space)
O Use attributes for formatting glade strings for easier translation (gtk 2.16)
O Consider using apport
O Set title for exports
O Get rid of python3.0 warnings
O Remove support for the notification area (http://design.canonical.com/2010/04/notification-area/)


  
1.3
O Password protection or encryption (Think about new format first)
O Add per journal configuration?


2.0
O Improve WYSIWYG? (Pro: direct copy-paste from browser with formatting) (Think about new format first)
O Let user change font, color fonts
O Copy all files and pictures into data subdirectory (Think about new format first)
O Image resizing with PIL? (Image module) (Figure out where to save new files first)

2.x
O Think about using desktop-couch?
O Use categories for number data and present it graphically (KMs, Cash, Calories)








=== Maybe even some of those features will make it into RedNotebook ===

O Evolution Integration (evolution zeitgeist addon is being written by zeitgeist devs)
O Picture slide show in one entry with many images (in preview show nice
      javascript slide show of pics in linked picture directory) (Think about new format first)
O HTML import?
O Include startup date patch?
O Change an entry's category (Useful for Todo items) (KISS?)
O Ability to make certain entries, eg. birthdays, with frequencies
  



=== Features that will **not** be implemented ===

- ``monospaced`` (we only want one font)
- verbatim / raw ( """/"" - supported, undocumented) (too confusing / poorly behaving)
- remote pictures (pictures would have to be downloaded and saved in a folder for exports)
- dataDir Lock (for multiple TRN instances) (unneeded)
- make date format configurable for exports (probably no one needs this as i18n already exists)
- Tags in text entries (e.g. @film:Batman) (KISS)
- remove search for categories and tags, as clouds already do that (Unituitive and not trivial to remove)
- Copy/Paste category entries (Too complicated)
- Add --portable command line parameter (The default config file is better)
- word wrapping while editing category entries (too complicated, would involve writing C code)
- Language selection for spell checking (is already implemented in new versions of gtkspell)
- Todo tab next to clouds (KISS)
- Automatic Backups (KISS, intruding, gentle messages are better)
- Rethink linebreaks? (Changing paragraphs in txt2tags will probably crash 
  everything, Current behaviour should be fine)
- allow opening config file from within RedNotebook
  (Probably no good idea as some options might be unavailable or confusing)
- Change to newer KeepNote Version? -> No. A stable webkit will be available everywhere soon.
- Make the Format button remember its last action -> No, current behaviour good enough.
- Tabs for different notebooks (KISS)
- Add option for time interval between automatic savings? (KISS)
- Link to other days (KISS)
- Mathematic equations (KISS)
- Let user select the language for RedNotebook in Windows installer (User wants his win language)
- Get proper file layout with one script not part of module (Everything works without name clashes)
- Use threads for file loading and link opening (Probably a bad idea since threads are a source of errors)
- List recently opened journals under "Journal" -> "Recently Used" (KISS, config option needed)
- Drag and Drop for Windows (gtk inter application dnd isn't implemented on win32)
- Use configobj for config files (KISS, Never change A running system ;)
- Search for multiple words at the same time (KISS)
