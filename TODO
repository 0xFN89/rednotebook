TODO / Roadmap:

If you have any suggestions or comments, feel free to contact me in the forum or
per mail. Even if a feature is listed here already it might speed up the 
implementation if you tell me that you'd like its addition ;)


Features that will **not** be implemented:
- ``monospaced``

Features that will probably soon be implemented:
O i18n
O Better comment code
O Undu and Redo functionality extended for Categories (use function pointers for restoring things)
O Allow submitting new entries with <Enter>
O Switch from libglade to GtkBuilder
O Automatic insertion of photo links for current day
O Automatic insertion of holidays
O way of embedding a formula/tag/etc that I can put in the template to automatically insert the current date (2 requests)
O Daily word count. At least the current date that is presently active.
O Spell Checker (unify markup and html textviews first) (2 requests)
O verbatim / raw ( """ - already supported, undocumented) / comments ( % already supported, undocumented)?
O allow opening config file from within RedNotebook?
O Fix opening files for Mac (os.system(open "name"))
O Rethink linebreaks
O make inserting date/time configurable
O let the search function highlight found strings in the page



Maybe even some of those features will make it into RedNotebook:
O Hyperlinks in Categories? -> Already implemented, add documentation
O dataDir Lock (for multiple TRN instances)? -> Probably not
O Tags in text entries (e.g. @film:Batman)?
O Add RedNotebook to Startup Programs
    0 Linux: Option in Program
    X Win: Installer Option
O Encryption XOR Password
O Allow dragging of files and pictures into RedNotebook
O remove search for categories and tags, as clouds already do that?
O Allow inserting directories
O Allow opening pictures by double-clicking them
O Allow remote pictures (pictures have to be downloaded and saved in a folder for exports)
O Copy/Paste category notes
O provide TrueCrypt encryption HowTo for Linux
