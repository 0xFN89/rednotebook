TODO / Roadmap:

If you have any suggestions or comments, feel free to contact me in the forum or
per mail. Even if a feature is listed here already it might speed up the 
implementation if you tell me that you'd like its addition ;)



=== Features that will probably soon be implemented ===

O i18n
O Better comment code
O Undu and Redo functionality extended for Categories (use function pointers for restoring things)
O Allow submitting new entries with <Enter>
O Switch from libglade to GtkBuilder
O way of embedding a formula/tag/etc that I can put in the template to automatically insert the current date (2 requests)
O Daily word count. At least the current date that is presently active. (Words, lines, chars)
O Spell Checker (unify markup and html textviews first) (2 requests)
O allow opening config file from within RedNotebook? (On advanced tab)
O Make RedNotebook portable
    O User dir configurable



=== Maybe even some of those features will make it into RedNotebook ===

O Hyperlinks in Categories? -> Already implemented, add documentation
O Tags in text entries (e.g. @film:Batman)?
O Add RedNotebook to Startup Programs
    0 Linux: Option in Program
    X Win: Installer Option
O Encryption XOR Password
O Allow dragging of files and pictures into RedNotebook
O remove search for categories and tags, as clouds already do that?
O Allow inserting directories
O Allow opening pictures by double-clicking them
O Copy/Paste category notes
O provide TrueCrypt encryption HowTo for Linux
O Use threads for file loading and link opening (Data opening takes 1.1 sec, other setups take 0.3 sec)
O more formatting options and examples (fill some days of the journal at first startup)
O Rethink linebreaks (Changing paragraphs in txt2tags will probably crash everything, so wait for rich text editing first)
O SSH, FTP saving -> Conduit HowTo







=== Roadmap ===

1.0
O WYSIWYG editing as an alternative to markup text?

0.9
O Automatic insertion of photo links for current day
O Automatic insertion of holidays

0.8.x
O Import of exported backups
O Automatic Backups

0.8.3
O Task bar icon

0.8.2
O Password protection
X Blacklist for clouds in GUI
X let the search function highlight found words
X Fix line breaks for exports
X Fix opening files on Mac
X Add little section about comments to Help text








=== Features that will **not** be implemented ===

- ``monospaced`` (we only want one font)
- verbatim / raw ( """/"" - supported, undocumented) (too confusing / poorly behaving) 
- remote pictures (pictures would have to be downloaded and saved in a folder for exports)
- dataDir Lock (for multiple TRN instances) (unneeded)
- make date format configurable for exports (probably no one needs this as i18n already exists)
