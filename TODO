TODO / Roadmap:

If you have any suggestions or comments, feel free to contact me in the forum or
per mail. Even if a feature is listed here already it might speed up the 
implementation if you tell me that you'd like its addition ;)


=== Roadmap ===
   

O Feature Poll

0.9.5
X Show week numbers in calendar
X Sort items in configuration.cfg
O Use Zeitgeist for automatic category entries (wait for zeitgeist-0.3 availability in distros)
  - Music tracks or albums
  - Pictures or picture folders
  - Movies
  - Web History
  - Documents
  - Mails
  - Twitter Messages

0.9.x
O Automatic insertion of photo links for current day (use zeitgeist)
O Automatic insertion of holidays
O Get rid of CamelCase in sourcecode
O Fix status icon on XFCE
O Try to get rid of PangoWarnings on Windows
O Drag and Drop for Windows

1.0
X Solid amount of translations
X Stable
X Fix freeze bug
O Many automatic insertions

1.0.x
O Custom-style Journals? (Mono-space)
O Image resizing with PIL? (Image module) (Figure out where to save new files first)
O Import of exported backups (Check if saving to 7z makes sense first)
O Use attributes for formatting glade strings for easier translation (gtk 2.16)
O Show warning if last backup dates to more than one month before
O Consider using apport

1.1
O Password protection or encryption
O Add per journal configuration

1.x
O Tabled Data?
O Document and highlight structured header feature (====Header====)

2.0
O Improve WYSIWYG? (Pro: direct copy-paste from browser with formatting)
O Let user change font, color fonts
O Copy all files and pictures into data subdirectory

2.x
O Think about using desktop-couch
O Use categories for number data and present it graphically (KMs, Cash, Calories)








=== Maybe even some of those features will make it into RedNotebook ===

O List recently opened journals under "Journal" -> "Recently Used"
O Provide an option to export all days with a certain tag

O Evolution Integration (zeitgeist?)
O ics import/export
O Insert sound and video
O Picture slide show in one entry with many images

O Use threads for file loading and link opening? (Data opening takes 1.1 sec, 
  other setups take 0.3 sec)
  (Probably a bad idea since threads are a source of errors)



=== Features that will **not** be implemented ===

- ``monospaced`` (we only want one font)
- verbatim / raw ( """/"" - supported, undocumented) (too confusing / poorly behaving)
- remote pictures (pictures would have to be downloaded and saved in a folder for exports)
- dataDir Lock (for multiple TRN instances) (unneeded)
- make date format configurable for exports (probably no one needs this as i18n already exists)
- Tags in text entries (e.g. @film:Batman) (KISS)
- remove search for categories and tags, as clouds already do that (Unituitive and not trivial to remove)
- Copy/Paste category entries (Too complicated)
- Add --portable command line parameter (The default config file is better)
- word wrapping while editing category entries (too complicated, would involve writing C code)
- Language selection for spell checking (is already implemented in new versions of gtkspell)
- Todo tab next to clouds (KISS)
- Automatic Backups (KISS, intruding, gentle messages are better)
- Rethink linebreaks? (Changing paragraphs in txt2tags will probably crash 
  everything, Current behaviour should be fine)
- allow opening config file from within RedNotebook
  (Probably no good idea as some options might be unavailable or confusing)
- Let the Preview and the Edit button keep the same size -> No, keep code simple
- Change to newer KeepNote Version? -> No. A stable webkit will be available everywhere soon.
- Make the Format button remember its last action -> No, current behaviour good enough.
- Tabs for different notebooks (KISS)
- Add option for time interval between automatic savings? (KISS)
- Link to other days (KISS)
- Mathematic equations (KISS)
- Let user select the language for RedNotebook in Windows installer (User wants his win language)
- Get proper file layout with one script not part of module (Everything works without name clashes)
