TODO / Roadmap:

If you have any suggestions or comments, feel free to contact me in the forum or
per mail. Even if a feature is listed here already it might speed up the 
implementation if you tell me that you'd like its addition ;)


Features that will probably soon be implemented:
O Import of exported backups
O i18n
O Better comment code
O Undu and Redo functionality extended for Categories (use function pointers for restoring things)
O CTRL-C should copy the html text when in view tab
O Update text descriptions
O Ignore list for clouds (e.g. right click on a word in the cloud and banish it to the list)
O Click on an existing category then right mouse click to add a new entry as 
  opposed to clicking new entry, then having to select the category.
O Add a list of previously associated tags
O Enable cut/paste using <ctrl>+c/+v, or +x to the categories edit box
O Fix: A modified category name is not modified in the  category drop down list
  until you reload the application.
O more formatting options and examples (fill some days of the journal at first startup)
O Fix opening files from mozembed


Maybe even some of those features will make it into RedNotebook:
O Hyperlinks in Categories?
O dataDir Lock (for multiple TRN instances)? -> Probably not
O Tags in text entries (e.g. @film:Batman)?
O Add RedNotebook to Startup Programs
    0 Linux: Option in Program
    O Win: Installer Option
O Task Bar Icon? -> Probably not
O Encryption XOR Password
O SSH, FTP saving
O more than one notebook
O Allow dragging of files and pictures into RedNotebook
O Check xulrunner paths at startup
O remove search for categories and tags, as clouds already do that?
