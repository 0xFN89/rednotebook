TODO / Roadmap:

If you have any suggestions or comments, feel free to contact me in the forum or
per mail. Even if a feature is listed here already it might speed up the
implementation if you tell me that you'd like its addition ;)


=== Roadmap ===

1.1.2
X Resize an image by adding ?width to the filename (e.g. [""file:///home/user/pic"".png?50])
X Tables
X Numbered lists
O "Export currently visible day only" option
O Use Zeitgeist for automatic category entries
  O Music tracks or albums (Write decibel/listen/exaile zeitgeist addon)
  X Movies

  O Lifeograph
  O Evernote
  O ics?
  O Wordpress?
  O Treepad?
  X Tomboy

O Provide an option to export only days with a certain tag
O Automatic insertion of photo links for current day (use zeitgeist or tracker to search hard-disk for photos)
O Automatic insertion of holidays (Search a website for holidays and display them in the category "Holidays")
O Make startup faster
O Fix status icon on XFCE (LP:525196)
O Custom-style Journals? (Allow custom css files for preview rendering, e.g. Mono-space)
O Use attributes for formatting glade strings for easier translation (gtk 2.16)
O Consider using apport
O Set title for exports
O Get rid of python3.0 warnings
O Remove support for the notification area on Linux (http://design.canonical.com/2010/04/notification-area/)
O Only export days that have category X if category X is selected?
O Let the next (prev) button have submenus (go to next entry, go to last entry)
O Windows: Enable spellcheck
O Translate help
O Add "AddThis" Buttons to homepage
O Rethink logfile
O Use argparse instead of optparse (wait for argparse availability, remove IndentedHelpFormatterWithNL)
O Ensure that date in export is bigger than rest of text
O Fix txt2tags for turkish locale -> Use new txt2tags version when it supports turkish locale
O Remember export and backup locations
O Windows: Add correct newline character for editing previews in notepad
O Search in annotations
O Do not write empty month files to disk
O Update search window when an annotation has been added/changed?
O Install .mo files (translations) in the standard directories (check for better build system first)
O Make windows installer truly portable (leave no traces in registry)
O Possibility to show all entries (Search for "*"?)
O Do not allow starting two instances at the same time
O Remove keepnote and htmltextview sources (make webkit mandatory first)
O Show by default the most recent entries at the top of the search list, or else to remember the ascending/descending order date selected
O Create mono icon for panel?
O Regularly check for new webkit version that supports chinese fonts


1.3
O Password protection or encryption (Think about new format first)
O Add per journal configuration?
O Internal links


2.0
O Improve WYSIWYG? (Pro: direct copy-paste from browser with formatting) (Think about new format first)
O Let user change font, color fonts, highlighting colors
O Copy all files and pictures into data subdirectory (Think about new format first)
O Image resizing with PIL? (Image module) (Figure out where to save new files first)


2.x
O Think about using desktop-couch?
O Use categories for number data and present it graphically (KMs, Cash, Calories)
O RTF export








=== Maybe even some of those features will make it into RedNotebook ===

O Evolution Integration (evolution zeitgeist addon is being written by zeitgeist devs)
O Picture slide show in one entry with many images (in preview show nice
      javascript slide show of pics in linked picture directory) (Think about new format first)
O HTML import?
O Include startup date patch? (LP:655381, https://sourceforge.net/apps/phpbb/rednotebook/viewtopic.php?f=3&t=121)
O Ability to make certain entries, eg. birthdays, with frequencies
O Show warning if last backup dates to more than one month before (User should take care of that)
O Use a custom config.t2t per diary (https://sourceforge.net/apps/phpbb/rednotebook/viewtopic.php?f=3&t=126)
O let editor change to edit mode when viewing today's record and to preview mode when viewing any other record
  https://sourceforge.net/apps/phpbb/rednotebook/viewtopic.php?f=4&t=140
O make date format configurable for exports (probably no one needs this as i18n already exists)
  https://sourceforge.net/apps/phpbb/rednotebook/viewtopic.php?f=3&t=139
O Add additional one-click menu (like the one with Search and Tags Cloud) that contains quick links to other journals
  (https://sourceforge.net/apps/phpbb/rednotebook/viewtopic.php?f=4&t=23&sid=210fbd0a19cc2d2d5baec8c5cafb7c1f&p=582#p583)
O I also see a problem with both 1.1.1 and 1.1.2 version of the WIndows package.
  The 'hanging' occurs after navigating the cursor through the main edit window
  (in edit mode). Pressing the 'home' key or 'end' key usually causes a short beep
  and then locks my rednotebook application. The only thing I can then do is force
  the applicaiton to close. I have no such problems with the 1.1.0 version (with
  the 'older' user interface).





=== Features that will **not** be implemented ===

- ``monospaced`` (we only want one font)
- verbatim / raw ( """/"" - supported, undocumented) (too confusing / poorly behaving)
- remote pictures (pictures would have to be downloaded and saved in a folder for exports)
- dataDir Lock (for multiple TRN instances) (unneeded)
- Tags in text entries (e.g. @film:Batman) (KISS)
- remove search for categories and tags, as clouds already do that (Unituitive and not trivial to remove)
- Copy/Paste category entries (Too complicated)
- Add --portable command line parameter (The default config file is better)
- word wrapping while editing category entries (too complicated, would involve writing C code)
- Language selection for spell checking (is already implemented in new versions of gtkspell)
- Todo tab next to clouds (KISS)
- Automatic Backups (KISS, intruding, gentle messages are better)
- Rethink linebreaks? (Changing paragraphs in txt2tags will probably crash
  everything, Current behaviour should be fine)
- allow opening config file from within RedNotebook
  (Probably no good idea as some options might be unavailable or confusing)
- Change to newer KeepNote Version? -> No. A stable webkit will be available everywhere soon.
- Make the Format button remember its last action -> No, current behaviour good enough.
- Tabs for different notebooks (KISS)
- Add option for time interval between automatic savings? (KISS)
- Link to other days (KISS)
- Mathematic equations (KISS), MathJax (too big)
- Let user select the language for RedNotebook in Windows installer (User wants his win language)
- Get proper file layout with one script not part of module (Everything works without name clashes)
- Use threads for file loading and link opening (Probably a bad idea since threads are a source of errors)
- List recently opened journals under "Journal" -> "Recently Used" (KISS, config option needed)
- Drag and Drop for Windows (gtk inter application dnd isn't implemented on win32)
- Use configobj for config files (KISS, Never change A running system ;)
- Search for multiple words at the same time (KISS)
- For each journal to have its own templates (KISS)
- Let the Search type selection remember the selection between sessions (KISS)
- Let the Annotate and Tag window box remember their positions between sessions (KISS)
- Change an entry's category (Useful for Todo items) (KISS)
- Select template file when clicking the button instead of adding weekday's file
