TODO / Roadmap:

If you have any suggestions or comments, feel free to contact me on the mailing
list or directly per mail. Even if a feature is listed here already it might
speed up the implementation if you tell me that you'd like its addition ;)

1.2
X Let the "Back" and "Forward" button jump over blank days

X Remember scrollbar positions when changing between days and edit and preview mode
X Restore previous cursor position and text selection in edit mode when coming
  from preview mode or another day
X Allow double backslashes (\\) in filenames (e.g. for UNC paths)
X Use auto-completion for all category entries
X Allow linebreaks (\\) only at the end of lines

X Abort startup if a yaml file cannot be read
X Escape regular expression syntax in searches (*, +, etc.)
X Use a better icon for Annotate (Edit)
X Code optimizations
X Remove old cloud implementation
X Remove external module htmltextview.py
X Remember last export and backup locations
X Search in annotations
X Do not write empty month files to disk

O Install .mo files (translations) in the standard directories (wait for distutils2)
O Make windows installer truly portable (leave no traces in registry)
O Possibility to show all entries (Search for "*"?)

=== Maybe even some of those features will make it into RedNotebook ===

O Evolution Integration (evolution zeitgeist addon is being written by zeitgeist devs)
O Picture slide show in one entry with many images (in preview show nice
  javascript slide show of pics in linked picture directory) (Think about new format first)

  (https://sourceforge.net/apps/phpbb/rednotebook/viewtopic.php?f=4&t=23&sid=210fbd0a19cc2d2d5baec8c5cafb7c1f&p=582#p583)
O Plugin system?

=== Features that will **not** be implemented ===

- ``monospaced`` (we only want one font)
- verbatim / raw ( """/"" - supported, undocumented) (too confusing / poorly behaving)
- remote pictures (pictures would have to be downloaded and saved in a folder for exports)
- dataDir Lock (for multiple TRN instances) (unneeded)
- Tags in text entries (e.g. @film:Batman) (KISS)
- remove search for categories and tags, as clouds already do that (Unituitive and not trivial to remove)
- Copy/Paste category entries (Too complicated)
- Add --portable command line parameter (The default config file is better)
- word wrapping while editing category entries (too complicated, would involve writing C code)
- Language selection for spell checking (is already implemented in new versions of gtkspell)
- Todo tab next to clouds (KISS)
- Automatic Backups (KISS, intruding, gentle messages are better)
- Rethink linebreaks? (Changing paragraphs in txt2tags will probably crash
  everything, Current behaviour should be fine)
- allow opening config file from within RedNotebook
  (Probably no good idea as some options might be unavailable or confusing)
- Make the Format button remember its last action -> No, current behaviour good enough.
- Tabs for different notebooks (KISS)
- Add option for time interval between automatic savings? (KISS)
- Let user select the language for RedNotebook in Windows installer (User wants his win language)
- Get proper file layout with one script not part of module (Everything works without name clashes)
- Use threads for file loading and link opening (Probably a bad idea since threads are a source of errors)
- List recently opened journals under "Journal" -> "Recently Used" (KISS, config option needed)
- Drag and Drop for Windows (gtk inter application dnd isn't implemented on win32)
- Use configobj for config files (KISS, Never change A running system ;)
- Search for multiple words at the same time (KISS)
- For each journal to have its own templates (KISS)
- Let the Search type selection remember the selection between sessions (KISS)
- Let the Annotate and Tag window box remember their positions between sessions (KISS)
- Select template file when clicking the button instead of adding weekday's file
- Use categories for number data and present it graphically (KMs, Cash, Calories) (KISS)
- Check for duplicates in cloud blacklists (Does not make much sense since each word
  can only be right-clicked once in the cloud)
- Right-click on word in main text area to add it to cloud whitelist
  (Functionality will be difficult to find, would have to be implemented for
  preview as well)
- Add online mathjax support (see Snippets/mathjax-test.html)
  (too much effort probably and not so many people actually use formulas)
- Image resizing with PIL (The width parameter is more useful)
