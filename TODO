TODO / Roadmap:

If you have any suggestions or comments, feel free to contact me in the forum or
per mail. Even if a feature is listed here already it might speed up the 
implementation if you tell me that you'd like its addition ;)

      javascript slide show of pics in linked picture directory) (Think about new format first)

O Change an entry's category (Useful for Todo items) (KISS?)
O Ability to make certain entries, eg. birthdays, with frequencies
O Show warning if last backup dates to more than one month before (User should take care of that)

O let editor change to edit mode when viewing today's record and to preview mode when viewing any other record
  https://sourceforge.net/apps/phpbb/rednotebook/viewtopic.php?f=4&t=140
O make date format configurable for exports (probably no one needs this as i18n already exists)
  https://sourceforge.net/apps/phpbb/rednotebook/viewtopic.php?f=3&t=139
O Add additional one-click menu (like the one with Search and Tags Cloud) that contains quick links to other journals
  (https://sourceforge.net/apps/phpbb/rednotebook/viewtopic.php?f=4&t=23&sid=210fbd0a19cc2d2d5baec8c5cafb7c1f&p=582#p583)



=== Features that will **not** be implemented ===

- ``monospaced`` (we only want one font)
- verbatim / raw ( """/"" - supported, undocumented) (too confusing / poorly behaving)
- remote pictures (pictures would have to be downloaded and saved in a folder for exports)
- dataDir Lock (for multiple TRN instances) (unneeded)
- Tags in text entries (e.g. @film:Batman) (KISS)
- remove search for categories and tags, as clouds already do that (Unituitive and not trivial to remove)
- Copy/Paste category entries (Too complicated)
- Add --portable command line parameter (The default config file is better)
- word wrapping while editing category entries (too complicated, would involve writing C code)
- Language selection for spell checking (is already implemented in new versions of gtkspell)
- Todo tab next to clouds (KISS)
- Automatic Backups (KISS, intruding, gentle messages are better)
- Rethink linebreaks? (Changing paragraphs in txt2tags will probably crash 
  everything, Current behaviour should be fine)
- allow opening config file from within RedNotebook
  (Probably no good idea as some options might be unavailable or confusing)
- Change to newer KeepNote Version? -> No. A stable webkit will be available everywhere soon.
- Make the Format button remember its last action -> No, current behaviour good enough.
- Tabs for different notebooks (KISS)
- Add option for time interval between automatic savings? (KISS)
- Link to other days (KISS)
- Mathematic equations (KISS)
- Let user select the language for RedNotebook in Windows installer (User wants his win language)
- Get proper file layout with one script not part of module (Everything works without name clashes)
- Use threads for file loading and link opening (Probably a bad idea since threads are a source of errors)
- List recently opened journals under "Journal" -> "Recently Used" (KISS, config option needed)
- Drag and Drop for Windows (gtk inter application dnd isn't implemented on win32)
- Use configobj for config files (KISS, Never change A running system ;)
- Search for multiple words at the same time (KISS)
