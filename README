====== RedNotebook ======

There are many packages available for different distributions, so you might
want to check the Downloads page first.

It is recommended to install the distribution's appropriate package, 
but of course sometimes you want to try out the bleeding edge, hot new stuff.

In order to not mess with your distribution's package system, you might
want to just run the program, without installing it.
