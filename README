====== RedNotebook ======

===== REQUIREMENTS =====
  - Python (2.5) (www.python.org)
  - PyYaml (3.05) (www.yaml.org)
  - PyGTK (2.13) (www.pygtk.org)
  
  
    === Ubuntu/Debian ===
    sudo apt-get install python-yaml python-gtk2
    
    optionally: sudo apt-get install python-gnome2-extras
    

    === Fedora ===
    yum -y install python-devel PyYAML
    
    optionally: yum -y install gnome-python2-gtkmozembed
    
    
    
    === Optional ===
    
    - python-gtkmozembed can be used optionally.
      RedNotebook can run without it, but if you want to see the day preview 
      inside RedNotebook instead of in your browser, please install gtkmozembed.
      Sometimes it is found packages called python-gnome2-extras or similar.
    


===== INSTALL =====

as root run 'python setup.py install'
(install into path-to-python/site-packages/)

or run 'python setup.py install --root=testDir'
(install into current-directory/testDir/path-to-python/site-packages/)


===== RUN =====

If you installed the program into "site-packages" you can now run the command "rednotebook"
in any shell.

Otherwise navigate to the "rednotebook" directory and run "python redNotebook.py".


    == GTKMozembed ==
    If RedNotebook crashes at startup, there is probably a problem with GTKMozembed.
    To solve it, you can edit $HOME/.rednotebook/configuration.cfg (The file will exist
    after the first execution of RedNotebook).
    In the config file you must change the two paths containing "xulrunner" to 
    point to the correct location of xulrunner on your system.
    
    If that does not solve the problem, try setting useGTKMozembed to 0.
