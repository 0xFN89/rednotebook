===== THANKS =====

  - The authors of the programs listed under 'requirements'. Remember that
			without them, RedNotebook would not be possible
  - Everaldo Coelho (www.everaldo.com) for the excellent icon
  - The txt2tags team (http://txt2tags.sf.net) for their super cool markup tool
  - Gustavo J. A. M. Carneiro for his htmltextview.py module used by the clouds

			Their work can be downloaded from http://tango.freedesktop.org/
