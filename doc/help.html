<a id="toc1" name="toc1"></a>
<h2>Layout</h2>

<p>
The interface is divided into three parts:
</p>

<ul>
<li><b>Left</b>: Navigation with the calendar
</li>
<li><b>Center</b>: Text for a day
</li>
<li><b>Right</b>: Annotations to a day
</li>
</ul>

<p>
There are two modes in RedNotebook, the <u>editing</u> mode and the <u>preview</u> mode.
</p>

<a id="toc2" name="toc2"></a>
<h2>Text</h2>

<p>
The main text field is the container for your normal diary entries like this one:
</p>
<p>
Today I went to the <i>pet shop</i> and bought a <b>tiger</b>. Then we went to the <strike>pool</strike> park and had a nice time playing ultimate frisbee. Afterwards we watched "<u>Life of Brian</u>".
</p>

<a id="toc3" name="toc3"></a>
<h2>Format</h2>

<p>
As you see, the text can be formatted <b>bold</b>, <i>italic</i>, <strike>struck through</strike> and <u>underlined</u>. As a convenience there is also the "Format" button, with which you can format the main text and entries in the categories tree on the right.
</p>
<p>
A blank line starts a new <b>paragraph</b>, two backslashes<br /> result in a <b>newline</b>.
</p>
<p>
To see the result, click on the "Preview" button.
You can also see how this text was formatted by looking at its <a href="source.txt">source</a>.
</p>
<p>
<b>Lists</b> can be created by using the following style, If you use "+"
instead of "-" you can create a <b>numbered list</b>.
</p>

<pre>
- First Item
  - Indented Item
- Do not forget two blank lines after a list


</pre>

<a id="toc4" name="toc4"></a>
<h2>Annotations in Categories</h2>

<p>
Annotations are notes that can be sorted into categories. For example you could create the category "Ideas" and then add today's ideas to it.
</p>
<p>
Have a look at the right to see example categories with example entries.
</p>
<p>
The name "Categories" is a little bit confusing. It does not mean that a day is put into a category, but that there is additional content on the right, sorted into categories. A category will contain several notes distributed over various days.
</p>
<p>
For example you could want to remember all the movies you watch. Each time you watch a new one, add the category "Movies" with the entry "Name of the movie" to the day.
</p>
<p>
I’ll give you another example: I like to maintain a list of cool things I have done. So if I did a cool thing on some day, I navigate to that day and add the category "Cool Stuff" with the entry "Visit the pope" (Sadly I haven’t done that, yet ;-) ). When I have done more cool things on many days, they all have a category "Cool Stuff" and many different entries. It is possible to export only that category and get a list of the cool stuff that happened to me with the respective dates.
</p>
<p>
Additionally you can select the "Cool Stuff" category in the word cloud window to get a list of all the cool things.
</p>
<p>
Maybe a good thing to know is the following:
"Tags" is a category, the tagnames are entries in the category "Tags", distributed over various days.
Similarly you can have a category "Movies" and add it together with the movie's name to every day on which you see a new film.
</p>
<p>
Category entries can have all of the formatting that the main text supports, so e.g. you can add bold text, links or images.
</p>

<a id="toc5" name="toc5"></a>
<h2>Images, Files and Links</h2>

<p>
RedNotebook lets you insert images, files and links into your entries. To do so, select the appropriate option in the "Insert" pull-down menu above the main text field. The text will be inserted at the current cursor position.
</p>
<p>
With the insert button you cannot insert <b>links to directories</b> on your computer. Those can be inserted manually however ([Home ""file:///home/]"").
</p>

<a id="toc6" name="toc6"></a>
<h2>Templates</h2>

<p>
RedNotebook supports templates. Click on the arrow next to the "Template" button to see some options. You can have one template for every day of the week and unlimited arbitrarily named templates.
The files 1.txt to 7.txt in the template directory correspond to the templates for each day of the week. The current weekday's template will be filled into the text area when you click on "Template". You can open the template files from inside RedNotebook by opening the menu next to the "Template" button.
</p>

<a id="toc7" name="toc7"></a>
<h2>Tags</h2>

<p>
Tagging an entry (e.g. with the tag "Work") is also easy: On the right, click on "Add Tag" and insert "Work" into the lower textbox. The result looks like:
</p>

<ul>
<li>Tags
  <ul>
  <li>Work
  </li>
  </ul>
</li>
</ul>

<p>
You can see a tag cloud on the left by activating the "Clouds" tab and selecting "Tags". Get a list of all tags with a given name by clicking on that tag in the cloud.
</p>

<a id="toc8" name="toc8"></a>
<h2>Search</h2>

<p>
On the left you find the search box. You can search for text, display a category's content or show all days with a given tag. Double-clicking on a day lets you jump to it.
</p>

<a id="toc9" name="toc9"></a>
<h2>Clouds</h2>

<p>
Clicking on the "Clouds" tab on the left lets you view the most often used words in your journal.
You can select to view your category or tag clouds by clicking on the scroll-down menu.
If words appear in the cloud that you don't want to see there, just right-click on them. Alternatively you can open the Preferences dialog and add the words to the cloud blacklist there.
</p>

<a id="toc10" name="toc10"></a>
<h2>Spellcheck</h2>

<p>
RedNotebook supports spellchecking your entries if you have python-gtkspell installed (Only available on Linux). To highlight all misspelled words in your entries, select the corresponding option in the preferences window.
</p>
<p>
Since gtkspell 2.0.15, you can select the spellchecking language by right-clicking on the main text area (in edit mode) and choosing it from the submenu "Languages".
</p>

<a id="toc11" name="toc11"></a>
<h2>Options</h2>

<p>
Make sure you check out the customizable options in the Preferences dialog. You can
open this dialog by clicking on the entry in the "Edit" menu.
</p>

<a id="toc12" name="toc12"></a>
<h2>Save</h2>

<p>
Everything you enter will be saved automatically at regular intervals and when you exit the program. To avoid data loss you should backup your journal regularly. "Backup" in the "Journal" menu saves all your entered data in a zip file.
</p>

<a id="toc13" name="toc13"></a>
<h2>Export</h2>

<p>
In the "Journal" menu you also find the "Export" button. Click on "Export" and export your diary to Plain Text, HTML or Latex.
</p>
<p>
Since version 0.9.2 you can also directly export your journal to PDF. If the option does not show up in the export assistant, you need to install pywebkitgtk version 1.1.5 or later (the package is sometime called python-webkit).
</p>
<p>
<b>Latex caveats</b>
</p>
<p>
Make sure to type all links with the full path including the protocol:
</p>

<ul>
<li><a href="http://www.wikipedia.org">http://www.wikipedia.org</a> or <a href="http://wikipedia.org">http://wikipedia.org</a> (<strike>wikipedia.org</strike>, <strike>"www.wikipedia.org"</strike>)
</li>
<li>file:///home/sam/myfile.txt (<strike>/home/sam/myfile.txt</strike>)
</li>
</ul>

<a id="sync" name="sync"></a>
<h2>Synchronize across multiple computers</h2>

<p>
Syncing RedNotebook with a remote server is easy. You can either use a cloud service like Ubuntu One or Dropbox or save your journal to your own server.
</p>

<a id="toc15" name="toc15"></a>
<h3>Ubuntu One and Dropbox</h3>

<p>
If you are registered for either <a href="http://one.ubuntu.com">Ubuntu One</a> or <a href="http://www.dropbox.com">Dropbox</a>, you can just save your journal in a subfolder of the respective synchronized folder in your home directory.
</p>

<a id="toc16" name="toc16"></a>
<h3>Directly save to remote FTP or SSH server</h3>

<p>
Since version 0.8.9 you can have your journal directory on a remote server. The feature is however only available on Linux machines. To use the feature you have to connect your computer to the remote server. This is most easily done in Nautilus by clicking on "File" -&gt; "Connect to Server". Be sure to add a bookmark for the server. This way you can see your server in Nautilus at all times on the left side. The next time you open RedNotebook you will find your server in the "New", "Open" and "Save As" dialogs. There you can select a new folder on the server for your journal.
</p>

<a id="toc17" name="toc17"></a>
<h3>External sync with remote server</h3>

<p>
If you have your own server, you might want to try <a href="http://www.conduit-project.org">Conduit</a> or <a href="http://www.cis.upenn.edu/~bcpierce/unison">Unison</a> for example. To sync or backup your journal you have to sync your journal folder (default is "$HOME/.rednotebook/data/") with a folder on your server. It would be great if someone could write a tutorial about that.
</p>
<p>
Obviously you have to be connected to the internet to use that feature. Be sure to backup your data regularly if you plan to save your content remotely. There are always more pitfalls when an internet connection is involved.
</p>

<a id="toc18" name="toc18"></a>
<h3>Dual Boot</h3>

<p>
Using RedNotebook from multiple operating systems on the same computer is also possible. Save your Journal with "Journal-&gt;Save As" in a directory all systems can access. Then on the other systems you can open the journal with "Journal-&gt;Open".
</p>
<p>
Optionally you can also <b>share your settings</b> and templates. This is possible since version 0.9.4. The relevant setting is found in the file "rednotebook/files/default.cfg". There you can set the value of userDir to the path where you want to share your settings between the systems.
</p>

<a id="toc19" name="toc19"></a>
<h2>Portable mode</h2>

<p>
RedNotebook can be run in portable mode. In this mode, the template directory and the configuration and log file are saved in the application directory instead of in the home directory. Additionally the path to the last opened journal is remembered relatively to the application directory.
</p>
<p>
To use RedNotebook on a flash drive on Windows, run the installer and select a directory on your USB drive as the installation directory. You probably don't need the "Start Menu Group" and Desktop icons in portable mode.
</p>
<p>
To <b>activate portable mode</b>, change into the files/ directory and in the default.cfg file set portable=1.
</p>

<a id="toc20" name="toc20"></a>
<h2>Convert Latex output to PDF</h2>

<p>
In recent RedNotebook versions you can export your journal directly to PDF, so this section may be obsolete. However, there may be some people who prefer to export their journal to Latex first and convert it to PDF later. Here is how you do it:
</p>

<a id="toc21" name="toc21"></a>
<h3>Linux</h3>

<p>
For the conversion on Linux you need some extra packages: texlive-latex-base and texlive-latex-recommended. Maybe you also need texlive-latex-extra. Those contain the pdflatex program and are available in the repositories of most Linux distros.
</p>
<p>
You can convert the .tex file by typing the following text in a command line: 
<code>pdflatex your-rednotebook-export.tex</code>
</p>
<p>
Alternatively you can install a Latex editor like Kile (<a href="http://kile.sourceforge.net/">http://kile.sourceforge.net/</a>), open the .tex file with it and hit the export button.
</p>
<p>
However there are some pitfalls: Sometimes not all exported characters can be converted to pdf.
E.g. problems occur when exporting the euro sign (€) or other "non-standard" characters to pdf.
</p>
<p>
If you run into any problems during the conversion, the easiest way to solve them is to install a latex editor and do the conversion with it. That way you can see the errors right away and get rid of them by editing the file.
</p>

<a id="toc22" name="toc22"></a>
<h3>Windows</h3>

<p>
You can open an exported Latex file with Texniccenter and convert it to PDF with MikTex. Visit <a href="http://www.texniccenter.org/">www.texniccenter.org/</a> and <a href="http://www.miktex.org">www.miktex.org</a> for the programs and instructions. Basically you have to download both programs, open the .tex file with Texniccenter and select "Build Output" from the "Output" menu. The program will then create the beautifully looking PDF in the
same directory.
</p>

</p>

<a id="toc24" name="toc24"></a>
<h2>Encryption</h2>

<p>
You can use e.g. <a href="http://www.truecrypt.org">TrueCrypt</a> to encrypt your journal. Nick Bair has written a nice tutorial about <a href="http://sourceforge.net/apps/phpbb/rednotebook/viewtopic.php?f=3&amp;t=14">encrypting RedNotebook files</a> on Windows. The procedure for other operating systems should be similar. The general idea is to create and mount an encrypted folder with TrueCrypt and put your journal files in there.
</p>
<p>
In recent Linux distributions is has become pretty easy to encrypt your entire home partition. I would recommend that to anyone who wishes to protect her/his diary and all other personal files. This method is especially useful for laptop users, because their computers are more likely to be stolen. If you encrypt your home partition all RedNotebook data will be encrypted, too.
</p>

<a id="toc25" name="toc25"></a>
<h2>Tips</h2>

<a id="toc26" name="toc26"></a>
<h3>Multiple Entries</h3>

<p>
You can add multiple entries to one day in two ways:
</p>

<ul>
<li>Use two different journals (one named “Work”, the other “Play”)
</li>
<li>Separate your two entries by different titles (===Work===, ===Play===)
</li>
<li>Use a horizontal separator line (20 “=”s)
</li>
</ul>

<a id="toc27" name="toc27"></a>
<h3>Todo list</h3>

<p>
You can also use RedNotebook as a todo list. A big advantage is, that you never have to explicitly state the date when you added the todo item, you just add it on one day and it remains there until you delete it.
</p>
<p>
Here is how it works:
</p>

<ul>
<li>On the right click on "New Entry"
</li>
<li>Fill "Todo" and "Remember the milk" in the fields and hit "OK"
</li>
<li>Select the categories cloud from the drop down menu on the left
</li>
<li>Now you can click on "Todo" and see all your todo items
</li>
</ul>

<ul>
<li>To tick off a todo item you can strike it out by adding "--" around the item.
</li>
<li>To mark an item as important, add "**" around it.
</li>
</ul>

<p>
So <strike>Remember the milk</strike> becomes struck through and <b>Wash the dishes</b> becomes bold.
</p>
<p>
You can see all your todo items at once by clicking "Todo" in the category cloud on the left. There you can also group your todo items into important and finished items by hitting "Entry" at the top of the list.
</p>
<p>
It probably sometimes makes sense to add the todo items to the day you want to have completed them (deadline day).
</p>
<p>
Once you've finished an item, you could also change its category name from "Todo" to "Done".
</p>

<a id="toc28" name="toc28"></a>
<h3>Week Numbers</h3>

<p>
If you'd like to see the week numbers in the calendar, you can set the value of weekNumbers to 1 in the configuration file. This file normally resides at $HOME/.rednotebook/configuration.cfg
</p>

<a id="toc29" name="toc29"></a>
<h3>Language</h3>

<p>
If you want to change RedNotebook's language, setting the environment variable LANG to a different language code should be sufficient. Language codes have e.g. the format "de_DE" or "de_DE.UTF-8" (German). To set the language to English you can also set the code to "C".
</p>
<p>
On Linux, start a terminal and call <code>LANG=de_DE.utf8</code>. Then in the same terminal, run <code>rednotebook</code>. The language change will be gone however once you close the terminal.
</p>
<p>
On Windows, set or create a LANG environment variable with the desired code:
</p>

<ol>
<li>Right-click My Computer and click Properties.
</li>
<li>In the System Properties window, click on the Advanced tab.
</li>
<li>In the Advanced section, click the Environment Variables button.
</li>
<li>Click the New button and insert LANG at the top and e.g. de or de_DE or
  de_DE.UTF-8 (use your <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ISO_639-1">language code</a>).
</li>
</ol>

<a id="toc30" name="toc30"></a>
<h3>Titles</h3>

<p>
You can insert titles into your post by adding "="s around your title
text. = My Title = is the biggest heading, ====== My Title ====== is
the smallest heading. A title line can only contain the title, nothing
else.
</p>
<p>
Numbered titles can be created by using "+" instead of "=".
+ My Title + produces a title like "1.", ++++++ My Title ++++++
produces a title like 0.0.0.0.0.1
</p>

<a id="toc31" name="toc31"></a>
<h3>Insert HTML or Latex code</h3>

<p>
To insert custom code into your entries surround the code with single quotes. Use 2 single quotes for inline insertions and 3 single quotes if you want to insert a whole paragraph. For paragraphs be sure to put the single quotes on their own line. This feature requires you to use webkit for previews (Only available on Linux).
</p>

<table border="1">
<tr>
<th>Text</th>
<th>Output</th>
</tr>
<tr>
<td><code>''&lt;font color="red"&gt;Red&lt;/font&gt;''</code></td>
<td><font color="red">Red</font></td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td><code>''$a^2$''</code></td>
<td>$a^2$ (a<sup>2</sup> in Latex)</td>
</tr>
</table>

<p>
This feature can be used to insert e.g. latex formulas:
</p>

<pre>
'''
==\sum_{i=1}^{n} i = \frac{n \cdot (n+1)}{2}==
'''
</pre>

<p>
will produce a nice looking formula in the Latex export.
</p>

<a id="toc32" name="toc32"></a>
<h3>Verbatim text (Preserve format)</h3>

<p>
To insert preformatted text preserving newlines and spaces, you can use the backquotes (`). Use 2 backquotes for inline insertions and 3 backquotes if you want to insert a whole paragraph. For paragraphs be sure to put the backquotes on their own line. This feature requires you to use webkit for previews (Only available on Linux).
</p>
<p>
Two examples (have a look at the <a href="source.txt">source</a> to see how it's done):
</p>
<p>
To install rednotebook use <code>sudo apt-get install rednotebook</code>.
</p>

<pre>
class Robot(object):
    def greet(self):
        print 'Hello World'

robot = Robot()
robot.greet()
</pre>

<a id="toc33" name="toc33"></a>
<h3>Unparsed text</h3>

<p>
Formatting commands inside two pairs of "" are not interpreted (**not bold**).
</p>

<a id="toc34" name="toc34"></a>
<h3>Comments</h3>

<p>
Comments can be inserted after percent signs (<b>%</b>). They will not be shown in the preview and the exports. The % has to be the first character on the line.
</p>

<a id="toc35" name="toc35"></a>
<h3>List of all Entries</h3>

<p>
To get a list of all entries, just search for " " (the space character). This character is most likely included in all entries. You can sort the resulting list chronologically by pressing the "Date" button.
</p>

<a id="toc36" name="toc36"></a>
<h2>Command line options</h2>

<pre>
Usage: rednotebook [options] [journal-path]

RedNotebook 1.1.4

The optional journal-path can be one of the following:
 - An absolute path (e.g. /home/username/myjournal)
 - A relative path (e.g. ../dir/myjournal)
 - The name of a directory under $HOME/.rednotebook/ (e.g. myjournal)

If the journal-path is omitted the last session's journal will be used.
At the first program start this defaults to "$HOME/.rednotebook/data".


Options:
  -h, --help        show this help message and exit

  -d, --debug       Output debugging messages (default: False)

  -m, --minimized   Start mimimized to system tray (default: False)
</pre>

<a id="toc37" name="toc37"></a>
<h2>Data Format</h2>

<p>
In this paragraph I will explain shortly what the RedNotebook files consist of. Firstly it is important to understand that the content is saved in a directory with many files, not just one file. The directory name is used as a name for the journal.
</p>
<p>
In the directory there are several files all conforming to the naming scheme "2010-05.txt" (&lt;year&gt;-&lt;month&gt;.txt). Obviously these files correspond to months (May 2010).
</p>
<p>
Each month file contains text for the days of that month. The text is actually <a href="http://www.yaml.org">YAML</a> markup. Without the (unnecessary) python directives the files look like this:
</p>

<pre>
24: {text: "This is a normal text entry."}
25:
  Ideas: {"Invent Anti-Hangover machine": null}
  text: "This is another text entry, shown in the main text area."
</pre>

<p>
As you can see the data format uses a dictionary (or hashmap structure) for storing the information. The outer dictionary has the daynumbers as keys and the day content as values. The day values consist of another dictionary. It can have a key "text" whose value will be inserted in the main content area. Additionally there can be multiple other keys that stand for the categories that belong to that day. Each category contains a dictionary with only one key, the category entry.

<h2>Bugs</h2>

<p>
There is no software without bugs, so if you encounter one please drop me a note.
This way RedNotebook can get better not only for you, but for all users.
</p>
<p>
Bug reports should go <a href="https://bugs.launchpad.net/rednotebook">here</a>, but if you
don't know how to use that site, a simple mail is equally fine.
