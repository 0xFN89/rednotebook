== Text ==
The main text field is the container for your normal diary entries like this one:

Today I went to the //pet shop// and bought a **tiger**. Then we went to the --pool-- park and had a nice time playing ultimate frisbee. Afterwards we watched "__Life of Brian__".

== Format ==
As you see, the text can be formatted **bold**, //italic//, --struck through-- and __underlined__. As a convenience there is also the "Format" button, with which you can format the main text and nodes in the categories tree on the right.

A blank line starts a new **paragraph**, \ results in a newline.

% Formatting commands inside two pairs of "" are not interpreted (""**not bold**"")

**Comments** can be inserted after percent signs (**%**). They will not be shown in the preview and the exports. The % has to be the first character on the line.

To see the result, click on the "Preview" button.
You can also see how this text was formatted by looking at its [source source.txt].

== Annotations in Categories ==
On the right there is space for annotations to a day. Annotations are notes that can easily be sorted into categories. For example you could create the category "Ideas" and then add today's ideas to it.

- Ideas
  - Invent Anti-Hangover-Machine
- Movies
  - Monty Python and the Holy Grail


The name "Categories" is a little bit confusing. It does not mean that a day is put into a category, but that there is additional content on the right, sorted into categories. A category will contain several notes distributed over various days.

For example you could want to remember all the movies you watch. Each time you watch a new one, add the category "Movies" with the entry "Name of the movie" to the day.

I’ll give you another example: I like to maintain a list of cool things I have done. So if I did a cool thing on some day, I navigate to that day and add the category "Cool Stuff" with the entry "Visit the pope" (Sadly I haven’t done that, yet ;-) ). When I have done more cool things on many days, they all have a category "Cool Stuff" and many different entries. It is possible to export only that category and get a list of the cool stuff that happened to me with the respective dates.

Additionally you can select the "Cool Stuff" category in the word cloud window to get a list of all the cool things.

Maybe a good thing to know is the following: 
"Tags" is a category, the tagnames are entries in the category "Tags", distributed over various days. 
Similarly you can have a category "Movies" and add it together with the movie's name to every day on which you see a new film.

Category entries can have all of the formatting that the main text supports, so e.g. you can add bold text, links or images.

== Images, Files and Links ==
RedNotebook lets you insert images, files and links into your entries. To do so, select the appropriate option in the "Insert" pull-down menu above the main text field. The text will be inserted at the current cursor position.

With the insert button you cannot insert **links to directories** on your computer. Those can be inserted manually however (""[Home ""file:///home/""]"").

== Templates ==
RedNotebook supports templates. Click on the arrow next to the "Template" button to see some options. You can have one template for every day of the week and unlimited arbitrarily named templates. 
The files 1.txt to 7.txt in the template directory correspond to the templates for each day of the week. The current weekday's template will be filled into the text area when you click on "Template". You can open the template files from inside RedNotebook by opening the menu next to the "Template" button.

== Tags ==
Tagging an entry (e.g. with the tag "Work") is also easy: On the right, click on "Add Tag" and insert "Work" into the lower textbox. The result looks like:

- Tags
  - Work


You can see a tag cloud on the left by activating the "Clouds" tab and selecting "Tags". Get a list of all tags with a given name by clicking on that tag in the cloud.

== Search ==
On the left you find the search box. You can search for text, display a category's content or show all days with a given tag. Double-clicking on a day lets you jump to it.

== Clouds ==
Clicking on the "Clouds" tab on the left lets you view the most often used words in your journal.
You can select to view your category or tag clouds by clicking on the scroll-down menu.
If words appear in the cloud that you don't want to see there, just right-click on them. Alternatively you can open the Preferences dialog and add the words to the cloud blocklist there.

== Spellcheck ==
RedNotebook supports spellchecking your entries if you have python-gtkspell installed. To highlight all misspelled words in your entries, select the corresponding option in the preferences window.

Since gtkspell 2.0.15, you can select the spellchecking language by right-clicking on the main text area (in edit mode) and choosing it from the submenu "Languages".

== Options ==
Make sure you check out the customizable options in the Preferences dialog. You can
open this dialog by clicking on the entry in the "Edit" menu.

== Save ==
Everything you enter will be saved automatically at regular intervals and when you exit the program. To avoid data loss you should backup your journal regularly. "Backup" in the "Journal" menu saves all your entered data in a zip file.

=== Save to remote FTP or SSH server ===
Since version 0.8.9 you can have your journal directory on a remote server. The feature is however only available on Linux machines. To use the feature you have to connect your computer to the remote server. This is most easily done in Nautilus by clicking on "File" -> "Connect to Server". Be sure to add a bookmark for the server. This way you can see your server in Nautilus at all times on the left side. The next time you open RedNotebook you will find your server in the "New", "Open" and "Save As" dialogs. There you can select a new folder on the server for your journal.

Obviously you have to be connected to the internet to use that feature. Be sure to backup your data regularly if you plan to save your content remotely. There are always more pitfalls when an internet connection is involved.

== Export ==
In the "Journal" menu you also find the "Export" button. Click on "Export" and export your diary to Plain Text, HTML or Latex.

**Latex caveats**

Make sure to type all links with the full path including the protocol:

- http://www.wikipedia.org or http://wikipedia.org (--wikipedia.org--, --"""www.wikipedia.org"""--)
- file:///home/sam/myfile.txt (--/home/sam/myfile.txt--)


===Convert Latex output to PDF===

Since version 0.9.2 you can export your journal directly to PDF, so this section may be obsolete. However, there may be some people who prefer to export their journal to Latex first and convert it to PDF later. Here is how you do it:

**Linux**

For the conversion on Linux you need some extra packages: texlive-latex-base and texlive-latex-recommended. Maybe you also need texlive-latex-extra. Those contain the pdflatex program and are available in the repositories of most Linux distros.

You can convert the .tex file by typing the following text in a command line: 
"""pdflatex your-rednotebook-export.tex"""

Alternatively you can install a Latex editor like Kile (http://kile.sourceforge.net/), open the .tex file with it and hit the export button.

However there are some pitfalls: Sometimes not all exported characters can be converted to pdf.
E.g. problems occur when exporting the euro sign (€) or other "non-standard" characters to pdf.

If you run into any problems during the conversion, the easiest way to solve them is to install a latex editor and do the conversion with it. That way you can see the errors right away and get rid of them by editing the file.

**Windows**

You can open an exported Latex file with Texniccenter and convert it to PDF with MikTex. Visit www.texniccenter.org/ and www.miktex.org for the programs and instructions. Basically you have to download both programs, open the .tex file with Texniccenter and select "Build Output" from the "Output" menu. The program will then create the beautifully looking PDF in the
same directory.

== Keyboard Shortcuts ==
||   Action          |   Shortcut             |
| Preview (On/Off)   | <Ctrl> + P             |
| Find               | <Ctrl> + F             |
| Go back one day    | <Ctrl> + PageDown      |
| Go forward one day | <Ctrl> + PageUp        |
| Insert link        | <Ctrl> + L             |
| Insert date/time   | <Ctrl> + D             |
| New category entry | <Ctrl> + N             |
| Add Tag            | <Ctrl> + T             |

You can find other shortcuts in the menus.

== Tips ==
=== Multiple Entries ===
You can add multiple entries to one day in two ways:
- Use two different journals (one named “Work”, the other “Play”)
- Separate your two entries by different titles (===Work===, ===Play===)
- Use a horizontal separator line (20 “=”s)


====================

**Work**

Here goes the first entry.

====================

**Play**

Here comes the entry about the fun stuff.

=== Todo list ===
You can also use RedNotebook as a todo list. A big advantage is, that you never have to explicitly state the date when you added the todo item, you just add it on one day and it remains there until you delete it.

Here is how it works:
- On the right click on "New Entry"
- Fill "Todo" and "Remember the milk" in the fields and hit "OK"
- Select the categories cloud from the drop down menu on the left
- Now you can click on "todo" and see all your todo items


- To tick off a todo item you can strike it out by adding "--" around the item.
- To mark an item as important, add "**" around it.


So --Remember the milk-- becomes struck through and **Wash the dishes** becomes bold.

You can see all your todo items at once by clicking "todo" in the category cloud on the left. There you can also group your todo items into important and finished items by hitting "Entry" at the top of the list.

It probably sometimes makes sense to add the todo items to the day you want to have completed them (deadline day).

Once you've finished an item, you could also change its category name from "Todo" to "Done".

== Questions ==
If you have any questions or comments, feel free to post them in the [forum http://apps.sourceforge.net/phpbb/rednotebook/] or contact me directly.

== Bugs ==
There is no software without bugs, so if you encounter one please drop me a note.
This way RedNotebook can get better not only for you, but for all users.

Bug reports should go [here https://bugs.launchpad.net/rednotebook], but if you
don't know how to use that site, a simple mail is equally fine.
