====== Development notes ======

O WYSIWYG as an alternative to markup??? (keepnote and htmltextview as reference)
  notes:
    2 options: Save in html or txt2tags format
    HTML Editing: Keepnote
    HTML Saving: Keepnote
    HTML2txt2tags: Vim Script (port to python)
    HTML2markdown: python module exists
    HTML2Latex: Use HTML2txt2tags2Latex (write or use twisted lore)
    HTML2PDF: xhtml2pdf, http://code.activestate.com/recipes/532908/ possible, but only for plain text (no formatting)
              webkit is a better option here
    HTML2ODF: no suitable library at the moment. PyODF is buggy
    
    http://arstechnica.com/open-source/guides/2009/07/how-to-build-a-desktop-wysiwyg-editor-with-webkit-and-html-5.ars
  
    roadmap suggestion:
    wait for pywebkitgtk to stabilize a bit more (new ubuntu version)
    first add webkit as possible preview backend
    save all content directly in html to have way more editing options
  
O Encryption/Password
  - Save in password protected zipfiles (no open source tool to generate those)
    seems to be very easy to hack
  - Symmetric Encryption. AES (best method it seems)
        with PyCrypto
          http://www.dlitz.net/software/pycrypto/, 
          http://www.codekoala.com/blog/2009/aes-encryption-python-using-pycrypto/
          http://idsvandermolen.com/codefiles/crypto.py
          available in repos of all major distros
          ezpycrypto unneeded. mostly only simplifies key generation, ...
        Pure python AES module (check speed)
  - Truecrypt (Commandline): Would probably work, but requires installation of
    additional package that is not available in the repos
    
  --> Use pycrypto only
  
  - What should be encrypted? Files, Strings? -> Files better
    Lifeograph only writes to one file, encrypts a string
  
  - Maybe use only one file for a journal, add journal dependent variables
  - Maybe compress this file
  
  - AES uses fixed key-length -> bad for passwords -> use Blowfish with variable length
  - Blowfish faster than AES
  
  - Maybe just use 7z (only archive format that is widely known with good encryption (AES-256))
  - 7z can however also produce zip files with good encryption
  - For 7z package p7zip is needed (only supports 7z)
  - binary is called 7zr
  - Handling of extracted text files only in memory should be possible
    - What about pictures?
    
  - Maybe find a way to encrypt the whole directory
  
  
X Automatic insertions
  - Use code from Zeitgeist

  
X Spell-Checking
  - Enchant depends on aspell and hunspell on ubuntu
  - gtkspell depends on enchant
  - Use either aspell directly or through enchant
  - enchant is more up-to-date, but harder to use with gtk
  - gtkspell seems to be the easiest solution (python-gnome2-extras)
  
X Portable Version:
  Linux users can use the setting too, if all the computers have the RedNotebook
  requirements installed (pygtk, pyyaml)
  
  - Provide Option in Setup for running RedNotebook portable. Maybe use file
    that is only installed, when running this mode.
  
X Completely Translate Windows Version:
  - Inno Setup:
    - The {language} constant returns the internal name of the selected language.
    - On Windows NT/2000/XP/2003, environment variables are stored as string values 
      in the registry, so it is possible to manipulate them using the [Registry] section. 
      System-wide environment variables are located at:

      HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\SYSTEM\CurrentControlSet\Control\Session Manager\Environment

      User-specific environment variables are located at:

      HKEY_CURRENT_USER\Environment
      
    automatic gtk stuff: Registry?
    program strings:     lang variable
    gtkbuilder:          Registry?
