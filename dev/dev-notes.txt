====== Development notes ======

O WYSIWYG as an alternative to markup??? (keepnote and htmltextview as reference)
  notes:
    2 options: Save in html or txt2tags format
    HTML Editing: Keepnote
    HTML Saving: Keepnote
    HTML2txt2tags: Vim Script (port to python)
    HTML2markdown: python module exists
    HTML2Latex (write or use twisted lore)
    HTML2PDF: xhtml2pdf, http://code.activestate.com/recipes/532908/
	
	PDF generation: possible, but only for plain text (no formatting)
	ODF generation: no suitable library at the moment. PyODF is buggy
  
O Encryption/Password
  - Save in password protected zipfiles (no open source tool to generate those)
    seems to be very eays to hack
  - Symmetric Encryption. AES (best method it seems)
        with PyCrypto
  		  http://www.dlitz.net/software/pycrypto/, 
  		  http://www.codekoala.com/blog/2009/aes-encryption-python-using-pycrypto/
  		  http://idsvandermolen.com/codefiles/crypto.py
  		  available in repos of all major distros
  		  ezpycrypto unneeded. mostly only simplifies key generation, ...
  		Pure python AES module (check speed)
  - Truecrypt (Commandline): Would probably work, but requires installation of
    additional package that is not available in the repos
    
  --> Use pycrypto only
  
  - What should be encrypted? Files, Strings?
  
  
O Automatic insertions
  - Use code from Zeitgeist

  
X Spell-Checking
  - Enchant depends on aspell and hunspell on ubuntu
  - gtkspell depends on enchant
  - Use either aspell directly or through enchant
  - enchant is more up-to-date, but harder to use with gtk
  - gtkspell seems to be the easiest solution (python-gnome2-extras)
  
O Portable Version:
  Linux users can use the setting too, if all the computers have the RedNotebook
  requirements installed (pygtk, pyyaml)
