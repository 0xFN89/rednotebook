    <h3>Version 1.1.5 released - 2011-05-03</h3>
    <p class="content">This version fixes the insertion of the correct time.
    Additionally exports do not contain the "RedNotebook" title anymore
    allowing for easier custom usage of the exported files. Many translations
    have been updated.</p>

    <h3>Version 1.1.4 released - 2011-03-26</h3>
    <p class="content">This version fixes a critical bug that prevented the
    application from starting up if it had been minimized at shutdown.
    Two new templates "phone call" and "personal" have been added. The general
    usability and the help text have gotten better with many small fixes.</p>

    <h3>Version 1.1.3 released - 2011-03-02</h3>
    <p class="content">This version fixes a lot of bugs, especially
    on the Windows platform. Additionally some nice features have been added:
    RedNotebook now remembers its screen position across sessions and when
    it returns from the system tray. The sub-windows behave nicer as well and
    are now positioned relative to the main window. In the search pane you can
    now switch days with a single-click instead of a double-click. Unicode
    handling has been improved and pywebkitgtk is now an explicit requirement
    to make it possible to eventually drop the legacy substitutes. For a full
    list of the changes have a look at the
    <a href="http://bazaar.launchpad.net/~jendrikseipp/rednotebook/trunk/annotate/head:/CHANGELOG">Changelog</a>.
    Many thanks to the beta testers from the
    <a href="https://launchpad.net/~rednotebook">RedNotebook users group</a>.</p>

    <h3>Version 1.1.2 released - 2010-12-26</h3>
    <p class="content">Right on time for the latest Christmas notes RedNotebook 1.1.2 has been
    released. This version is the result of four months of development with the help of many
    beta testers from the <a href="https://launchpad.net/~rednotebook">RedNotebook users group</a>.
    Highlights of this version are: Fullscreen mode (F11), better search,
    structured headers and many bug fixes (especially for the windows version).</p>

    <h3>New project: Pogo - 2010-10-10</h3>
    <p class="content">Some info unrelated to RedNotebook: In the last weeks
    I have been busy writing a new <b>audio player</b> for Linux: <b>Pogo</b>. I had the feeling
    that there were not enough audio players already, so I thought I'd give it
    a try ;) Pogo is very fast, uses very little screen space and is easy-to-use.
    It doesn't have the bells and whistles of some other media players that try to
    play videos and walk your dog, instead it focuses on the
    essential stuff. It does have some bling though: Album covers are automatically downloaded and shown directly
    in the playlist. There is an intelligent playlist that groups your albums and
    does not show redundant album or artist information if a track is grouped.
    It also has Desktop Notifications and an equalizer. Give it a try at
    <a href="https://launchpad.net/pogo">launchpad.net/pogo</a>.</p>

    <h3>Version 1.1.1 released - 2010-08-21</h3>
    <p class="content">This release fixes many small issues and adds some minor features. Annotation editing
    has been improved and simplified. You can now delete annotations with the "DELETE" key. The size of the
    Windows installer has been reduced and the Windows version now uses a fresh theme and new icons.
    Additionally RedNotebook has been translated to British English and Norwegian Bokmal.</p>

    <h3>Flattering allowed - 2010-08-19</h3>
    <p class="content">Have a look at the exciting new micro-payment system <a href="http://flattr.com">
    Flattr</a>. If you like RedNotebook you can now flattr it at the bottom of this page (Currently disabled).</p>

    <h3>Version 1.1 released - 2010-08-03</h3>
    <p class="content">This is the first release on the way to RedNotebook 2.0. Lots of things have been cleaned up
    and improved. You can now search for dates, allowing you to show for example all days belonging to 2010-05.
    Additionally you can now jump directly to e.g. 2010-05-07. The integrated check for new versions is now slicker,
    and the program now restores the last opened tab (search or cloud view) when it is started.
    Invisible for the normal user, but an important improvement: The data files now contain only readable unicode text
    making your data even more future-proof and accessible.
    Many bugs have been fixed and translations have been updated for 18 languages.</p>

    <h3>New Homepage - 2010-08-02</h3>
    <p class="content">The new RedNotebook website has been launched. It features a cleaner structure and easier navigation.
    The design is based on the <a href="http://www.clementine-player.org/">Clementine homepage</a> by
    <a href="mailto:cjenkins@softwarelibrecr.org">Carlos Jenkins</a>.
    Please <a href="http://digitaldump.wordpress.com/about/">report</a> any errors you encounter.</p>

    <h3>Version 1.0 released - 2010-06-23</h3>
    <p class="content">This release marks the first big milestone of the project.
    All initial goals have been accomplished and now weâ€™ll see what the road to 2.0 will look like ;)
    Since 0.9.5 only small fixes have been made and the documentation and the translations have been updated.
    Hope you like it!</p>
