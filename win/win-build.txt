== Install requirements ==
  * Install Python 2.7 for Windows from the Python website [www.python.org].
  * Download and install the latest RedNotebook installer for Windows.
  * Add the directory containing rednotebook.exe to your PATH.
  * Install PyYaml for Python 2.7 from [http://pyyaml.org/wiki/PyYAML]
  * Install Bzr for Python 2.7 with TortoiseBzr (https://launchpad.net/bzr/+download)
  * Download the compiled webkitgtk bindings from
    https://dl.dropboxusercontent.com/u/4780737/pywebkitgtk.zip and add the
    contained "webkit" dir to C:\Python27\Lib\site-packages
  * Download the chardet package and add the "chardet" directory to C:\Python27\Lib\site-packages
  * Restart the system

== Test RedNotebook ==
  * Open the Explorer and right-click to branch a local copy of RedNotebook
  * Select "Bazaar Checkout or Branch" and branch the repo "lp:rednotebook"
  * Open a terminal window (cmd.exe) and navigate to PathToRedNotebook\rednotebook
  * Execute "python journal.py"
  * If you don't need an .exe file and no translations you're done.

== Build Exe ==
  * In the Explorer, go to the win directory and execute build-exe.bat
  * build-exe.bat runs the RedNotebook exe at the end. If nothing
    happens, have a look at
    C:\Documents and Settings\username\.rednotebook\rednotebook.log
  * Now clicking rednotebook.exe should start the application
    If it doesn't start, you'll hopefully find an error log in
    C:\D&S\User\.rednotebook\rednotebook.log

== Build the installer ==
  * Install Inno Setup (http://www.jrsoftware.org/isinfo.php)
  * Double-click rednotebook.iss
  * Adjust the two version numbers and the output directory
  * Click compile
  * Click run to test the installer
  * You find the installer in the output directory

Yay, you made it!
