====== Install GTK ======
(view http://faq.pygtk.org/index.py?req=show&file=faq21.001.htp for more details)
  * Install Python 2.6 for Microsoft Windows from the Python website [www.python.org] .
  * Install the latest GTK+ stack bundle provided by the GTK+ 
	project linked from [http://www.pygtk.org/downloads.html] or 
	[http://ftp.gnome.org/pub/GNOME/binaries/win32/gtk+/]
	(To fully install this bundle you need to uncompress its contents in a folder 
	and manually add the bin subfolder to the system path.)
  * Read the README.txt in the bundle zip file and check that GTK+ works
  * Install PyCairo, PyGobject and PyGTK installers from the PyGTK project 
    website [http://www.pygtk.org/downloads.html],
    note that you need them all installed to get PyGTK working.
  * Install PyYaml from [http://pyyaml.org/wiki/PyYAML]
	
====== Test RedNotebook ======
  * Checkout SVN (as you've already done)
  * Open a commandline and navigate to PathToRedNotebook\rednotebook
  * execute "python redNotebook.py"
  
====== Translations ======
  * Get the libglade-2.0-0.dll DLL from somewhere and copy it into the GTK\bin directory.
  * Move up one directory
  * Run "python setup.py i18n" to translate the po files to mo files

====== Build Exe ======
  * Install py2exe (http://www.py2exe.org/)
  * Open a terminal and navigate to RedNotebook's base directory (../ from here)
  * run 'python setup.py py2exe'
  * A dist/ directory is created containing the exe, but the GTK files are still missing
  * Copy the directories etc, lib and share from the GTK path to the newly created dist directory
  * If this wasn't done automatically, copy the directories "files/" and "images/" 
    from "rednotebook/" into "dist/" (omit hidden svn stuff)
  * You may want to remove the " doc" and "gtk-doc" subdirectories from the "share" directory
    They only contain html documentation for gtk
  * Now clicking redNotebook.exe should start the application
    If it doesn't start, you'll hopefully find an error log in C:\D&S\User\.rednotebook\rednotebook.log
  
====== Some important adjustments ======
  * To use the MS-Windows theme engine, create or edit a file in dist/etc/gtk-2.0/gtkrc
    containing the line:
    	gtk-theme-name = "MS-Windows"
  * We want to use a slightly optimized Windows style:
    * Change the filename of dist/share/themes/MS-Windows/gtk-2.0/gtkrc to gtkrc.bak
      to backup the file
    * Copy the file gtkrc from this directory to dist/share/themes/MS-Windows/gtk-2.0/
  * Sometimes the file jpg62.dll is missing in dist/
    * If it is not there, copy it from the GTK bin directory (or from somewhere on the internet) into dist/
    
====== Build the installer ======
  * Install Inno Setup (http://www.jrsoftware.org/isinfo.php)
  * Double-click rednotebook.iss
  * Adjust the two version numbers
  * Click compile
  * Click run to test the installer
  * YOu find the installer under output/
  
Yay, you made it!
