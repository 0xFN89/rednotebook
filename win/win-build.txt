====== Install GTK ======
(view http://faq.pygtk.org/index.py?req=show&file=faq21.001.htp for more details)
  * Install Python 2.5 or 2.6 for Microsoft Windows from the Python website [www.python.org] .
  * Install the latest GTK+ stack bundle provided by the GTK+ 
	project linked from [http://www.pygtk.org/downloads.html] or 
	[http://ftp.gnome.org/pub/GNOME/binaries/win32/gtk+/]
	(To fully install this bundle you need to uncompress its contents in a folder 
	and manually add the bin subfolder to the system path.)
  * Read the README.txt in the bundle zip file and check that GTK+ works
  * Install PyCairo, PyGobject and PyGTK installers from the PyGTK project 
    website [http://www.pygtk.org/downloads.html],
    note that you need them all installed to get PyGTK working.
  * Install PyYaml from [http://pyyaml.org/wiki/PyYAML]
	
====== Test RedNotebook ======
  * Checkout SVN (as you've already done)
  * Open a commandline and navigate to PathToRedNotebook\rednotebook
  * execute "python redNotebook.py"

====== Build Exe ======
  * Open a terminal and navigate to RedNotebook's base directory (../ from here)
  * run 'python setup.py py2exe'
  * A dist/ directory is created containing the exe, but the GTK files are still missing
  * Copy the directories etc, lib and share from the GTK path to the newly created dist directory
  * Copy the directories "files/" and "images/" from "rednotebook/" into "dist/"
  * Now clicking redNotebook.exe should start the application
  
====== Some important adjustments ======
  * To use the MS-Windows theme engine, create or edit a file in dist/etc/gtk-2.0/gtkrc
    containing the line:
    	gtk-theme-name = "MS-Windows"
  * We want to use a slightly optimized Windows style:
    * Change the filename of dist/share/themes/MS-Windows/gtk-2.0/gtkrc to gtkrc.bak
      to backup the file
    * Copy the file gtkrc from this directory to dist/share/themes/MS-Windows/gtk-2.0/
  * Sometimes the file jpg62.dll is missing in dist/
    * If it is not there, copy it from the GTK bin directory into dist/
    
====== Build the installer ======
  * Double-click rednotebook.iss
  * Adjust the two version numbers
  * Click compile
  * Click run to test the installer
  
Yay, you made it!
