====== Install GTK ======
(view http://faq.pygtk.org/index.py?req=show&file=faq21.001.htp for more details)
  * Install Python 2.4 or greater for Microsoft Windows from the Python website [www.python.org] .
  * Install the GTK+ 2.10 developer runtime from the GTK+/Glade for Win32 
    project website [http://gladewin32.sourceforge.net/] 
    or use the (more up-to-date) GTK+ stack bundle provided by the GTK+ 
	project linked from [http://www.pygtk.org/downloads.html]
  * Install PyCairo, PyGobject and PyGTK installers from the PyGTK project 
    website [http://www.pygtk.org/downloads.html] , 
    note that you need them all installed to get PyGTK working. 
	
====== Test RedNotebook ======
  * Checkout SVN (as you've already done)
  * Open a commandline and navigate to PathToRedNotebook\rednotebook
  * execute python redNotebook.py

====== Build Exe ======
  * Open a commandline and navigate to RedNotebook's base directory (../ from here)
  * run 'python setup.py py2exe'
  * A dist/ directory is created containing the exe, but the GTK files are still missing
  * Copy the directories etc, lib and share to the newly created dist directory
  * Now clicking redNotebook.exe should start the application
