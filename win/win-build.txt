== Install requirements ==
  * Install Python 2.7 for Windows from the Python website [www.python.org].
  * Download the PyGTK/GTK all-in-one installer and install the default subpackages.
    [http://ftp.gnome.org/pub/GNOME/binaries/win32/pygtk/2.24/]
  * Use the webkit libs from midori and copy them to the GTK runtime dir.
  * Install PyYaml for Python 2.7 from [http://pyyaml.org/wiki/PyYAML]
  * Install Bzr for Python 2.7 with TortoiseBzr (https://launchpad.net/bzr/+download)
  * Download the chardet package and add the "chardet" directory to C:\Python27\Lib\site-packages
  * Unpack the gtkspell package from pygtkaio.7z and copy the files to their destinations.
  * Restart the system

== Test RedNotebook ==
  * Open the Explorer and right-click to branch a local copy of RedNotebook
  * Select "Bazaar Checkout or Branch" and branch the repo "lp:rednotebook"
  * Open a terminal window and navigate to PathToRedNotebook\rednotebook
  * Execute "python journal.py"
  * If you don't need a .exe file and no translations you're done.

== Build Exe ==
  * Microsoft Visual Studio files:
    * In some environments the Visual Studio dlls are missing so we have
      to provide them
    * Find the files "Microsoft.VC90.CRT.manifest" and "msvcr90.dll" on
      your system or on the Microsoft homepage (search for Microsoft
      Visual C++ 2005 Redistributable Package (x86))and copy them into
      the win directory
  * Make sure py2exe is installed [http://www.py2exe.org/]
  * In the Explorer, go to the win directory and execute build-exe.bat
  * build-exe.bat runs the RedNotebook exe at the end. If nothing
    happens, have a look at
    C:\Documents and Settings\username\.rednotebook\rednotebook.log
  * A dist/ directory is created containing the exe, but some GTK files
    are still missing
  * Copy the directories etc, lib and share from the GTK path
    (C:\Python27\Lib\site-packages\gtk-2.0\runtime) to the newly created dist
    directory
  * You may want to remove some themes or dictionaries from the
    "share" directory to save some space.
  * Now clicking rednotebook.exe should start the application
    If it doesn't start, you'll hopefully find an error log in
    C:\D&S\User\.rednotebook\rednotebook.log

== Build the installer ==
  * Install Inno Setup (http://www.jrsoftware.org/isinfo.php)
  * Double-click rednotebook.iss
  * Adjust the two version numbers and the output directory
  * Click compile
  * Click run to test the installer
  * You find the installer in the output directory

Yay, you made it!
